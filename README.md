# Lung Nodules Detection using CT scan images

In this mini-project, I developed a deep learning model to accurately detect and classify lung nodules in CT scan images. I acquired a diverse dataset, preprocessed the images, and trained data. Techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning were employed to optimize the model's performance. The trained model was evaluated on a testing set, and its accuracy in nodule detection was measured.

This project showcased my skills in deep learning, computer vision, and problem-solving, with the potential to contribute to early lung cancer diagnosis.
